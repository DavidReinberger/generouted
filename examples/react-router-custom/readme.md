# Generouted + React Router Custom Integration Example

## What's different from the default integrations

- Custom integration added at [`./src/routes.tsx`](./src/routes.tsx)
  - Based on one of [`packages/generouted/src`](/packages/generouted/src) integrations
    - Copied from [`packages/generouted/src/react-router.tsx`](/packages/generouted/src/react-router.tsx)
    - Exports `<Routes />` component that's imported at app entry [`./src/main.tsx`](./src/main.tsx)
